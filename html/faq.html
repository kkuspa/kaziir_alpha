            <h2 class="subhead">The Launch</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><h3>What does signing up for the alpha launch do?</h3>
                  <p>Being a part of our launch grants you first-access as a student to our new platform connecting the communicty of elite students at Stanford to recruiters around the nation.</p></li>
              <li><h3>Who can sign up for the alpha launch?</h3>
                  <p>Any student with a Stanford email address. This means everyone from freshmen to grad students, whether you’re on-campus or abroad. Even if you’re graduating next quarter, you are absolutely welcome to sign up! You’ll be able to use our platform even after you graduate. Future releases will open it up to a wider audience, but for now we’re only providing the service to Stanford students.</p></li>
              <li><h3>When will the alpha launch be released?</h3>
                  <p>Right after Spring Break! Go have fun, relax, and unwind (or go hard for a week straight). When you come back and are ready for another quarter at Stanford, we’ll be LIVE.</p></li>
              <li><h3>How will I be notified?</h3>
                  <p>Through the email address you provide when signing up for the alpha-launch.</p></li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <br>
          <div class="basics">
            <h2 class="subhead">The Basics</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><h3>What can I do once I have my profile?</h3>
                  <p>Start scrolling through our challenges and see what gets you excited. What questions do you want to answer? What problems are you interested in?  When you find something that piques your interest start answering the question and invite your friends to work on the challenge with you.</p></li>
              <li><h3>What is a challenge?</h3>
                  <p>Challenges are the questions that companies post and that students have the option of answering along with any friends they wish to invite. The questions can be interview style, abstract, or anything the company thinks will give them insight into how you would perform working with them. There is no time limit to answering each question, but companies may only post questions for a certain period of time before they fill the position.</li>
              <li><h3>How do I invite my friends?</h3>
                  <p>Once you log into your account, an option will appear asking if you would like to connect with your contacts through email, FaceBook, or Linkedin. Once you find your friends you can send them invitations to join, and as soon as they are signed on you can add them directly through the answer page for the challenge you are currently working on.</li>
              <li><h3>How does a recruiter connect with my profile?</h3>
                  <p>If a company is interested in you they will send you an email to continue the interview process. Eventually we will design a messaging function within each profile, but in the interest of speed, we will be using email for the alpha-launch.</p></li>
              <li><h3>Why are companies' challenges anonymous?</h3>
                  <p>What are you truly passionate about? Chances are your answer to this question does not refer to a particular company, but rather is born from within. Your passion--whether scientific or social or literary, technological or political or humanitarian, artistic or musical or financial, or whatever--is what drives this site. We believe that by leaving the company names on the sideline and focusing purely on the content, you’ll have a chance to explore in earnest and maybe discover a match you would never have found through the usual career fairs and traditional job searches. That being said, we want to enable you to pursue your interests to the fullest. That’s why if you find a company whose challenges are so engaging, you just can’t get enough of them, their name will be revealed so you can use all channels at your disposal to learn more about how you might fit into their culture.</p></li>
              <li><h3>Why is my profile anonymous to the recruiters?</h3>
                  <p>Tackling some of the challenges here will push you to the very edge of your abilities. Some may seem tremendously challenging; they will require you to learn new skills and develop new thinking abilities. But by all means go for it. Push yourself. No need to worry about a “wrong” answer hurting your chances of getting hired through any other channel. For one, a “wrong” answer is nothing but another learning experience. But also, you are completely anonymous to all companies. Unless they're interested in hiring you. And well, at that point, you've probably been doing a lot of stuff “right.”</p></li>
              <li><h3>What is my user history?</h3>
                  <p>We want to be able to give you the most sophisticated tools on the internet to give you feedback on how you have been interacting with your companies and their challenges. Starting right with our alpha-launch and increasing in power as we develop, our core analytics will create a picture of your past interactions with companies so far and what types of skills or perspectives you have brought to the table. This also allows you to gain insights about what skills you most consistently call upon to answer challenges, and what skills you may need to sharpen in order to land your perfect job.</p> </li>
              <li><h3>Why analytics?</h3>
                  <p>Traditional methods of job searching funnel a larger list of applicants through resumes or Linkedin profiles, and only analyze those people who make it past the first "paper round" through an interview. We are creating an automated analysis that is much more powerful than a resume search that allows recruiters to get the best picture of you without interviewing you face-to-face. This allows recruiters to find the best matches the quickest.</p></li>
            </ul>
          </div>
            <div class="companies">
            <h2 class="subhead">The Companies</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><h3>Which companies will use this site?</h3>
                  <p>When we launch we will add a "companies" tab which will allow you to view a full list of every company represented by active challenges on the site.</p></li>
              <li><h3>What are companies looking for in a challenge answer?</h3>
                  <p>Many different things. Each company is unique. We will help you navigate this ocean by analyzing the searches that recruiters at companies across the entire platform are making, and suggesting some challenges that you’d be a good match for based on your previous responses. That is, when recruiters for that challenge conduct their search, your response is likely to appear near the top of the list.
              <li><h3>How do I contact companies directly?</h3>
                  <p>Each time you interact with an anonymous challenge, the company to which it belongs is notified that your profile is actively exploring their company. The more you interact with a specific company, the higher up on the list of "interested candidates" each company tracks will be held.</li>
              <li><h3>Can Companies track my history?</h3>
                  <p>Comapanies will be able to see all content you post directly on each of their challenges. However, they will NOT be able to view the content that you post the OTHER companies questions. What they will be able to see is a collection of meta-data collected through each of you answers to give more context about you as a person to their analysis of the specific questions you answer for a particular company.</p></li>
