          <h2>Hiring is Broken</h2>
          <p class= "minigraph">Getting a job today is harder than ever. You spend hours creating a great resume only to have a recruiter skim the bullet points. How can someone get a sense of who you are and what you can do from one glance at a sheet of paper?</p>

          <h2>How it Works</h2>
          <p class= "minigraph">Recruiters post interview questions on EigenLink that reflect the types problems their companies solve. Students collaborate with their friends to answer these questions which are intelligently organized to show recruiters the best matches.</p>

          <h2>Match your Passion</h2>
          <p class= "minigraph">Companies are blind to the students' identities, and students are blind to the identities of the companies. This frees both the student and recruiter to find the best fit for the job regardless of bias against age, identity, or major.</p>

          <p class="lead">We know there can be a lot of pressure to find a job fast...but what about a job that makes you happy? On EigenLink students can search questions posted anonymously by companies, and findn problems that they enjoy solving. By omitting certain information about the comapny at first, such as  the name of the company or it's size, you as a student can gain valuable insight into what it's really like working in that place. After you answer three challenges, the company's name is revealed. When a company finds that your profile matches their position through your answers on their questions, they can contact you directly. </p>

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Get your Voice Heard <span class="text-muted">LinkedIn isn't helping.</span></h2>
          <p class="lead">Connecting with companies can be frustrating. Resumes are sent and never acknowledged. Generic email addresses like "careers@company.com" seem like a black hole. But it's not these companies' fault - they have limited time and limited resources, so they take calculated bets on who out of a hundred they take a change to know and make their decision from there. The problem for both sides is they might be missing out on some great talent out there. The perfect candidate who left out a key buzzword on their resume is never given a chance to shine in that first interview. <span class="text-primary">Thatâ€™s what we do. We give everyone a fair shot at that first interview.</span> Then we give the recruiters the tools to search those interviews intelligently and efficiently.</p>

          <p class="lead">EigenLink is built on a strong foundation of algorithms that make associations between your interactions with companies, how you collaborate with your friends, and the skills you show when meeting your challenges. The more challenges you answer, the better we can match your interests, skills, and personality to the jobs out there that are similar to the questions you choose to answer. Even if you don't match the questions you answer directly, our core analytics can find what recruiters are searching for and show you other related jobs where you fit more precisely, increasing your chances of landing that job. You can also track your history and discover what types of jobs, companies and challenges you naturally gravitate towards to help you nail down what your passions truly is.</p>
